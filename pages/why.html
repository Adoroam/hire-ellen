	<p>I am one person dedicated to quality work. Not a faceless agency.  This works in your advantage. Here’s why.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Since I’m not supporting an entire army of editors, writers, and designers, I can charge well below standard market prices.</li>
		<li>One price. Half paid before. Half paid after. No hidden fees or BS price models. No guesswork about how much is going to be on your invoice.</li>
		<li>You will work with me directly at all times. Nothing gets passed up a chain.</li>
		<li>I’m not a salesman or a big business. I don’t accept every project that’s thrown at me. If we aren’t a good fit, I won’t waste your time.</li>
		<li>I keep my work load small and exclusive. Good writing and editing is an art to me. Not a “bulk job”.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>On top of this, I have a proven track record of success. Requests for references, custom samples, and one-on-ones are not just welcomed, they’re encouraged.</p>

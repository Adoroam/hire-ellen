	<p>My official title is "freelance ghost writer and editor". Really, though? I'm the person my clients turn to when they need beautiful to-the-point prose. My specialties are ghostwriting and content editing. That means two things.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you haven't started writing yet, I can get your idea out of your head and onto paper.</li>
		<li>If you've already started writing but need help, I can work with your words and make them do what you want them to do.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I work with any subject*, at any length. I hold a special place in my heart for fiction projects in particular. </p>
	<p class="small center">*I am comfortable writing about any non-adult subject. Some subjects take longer to write about than others. I provide exact timelines with my project quotes.</p>
